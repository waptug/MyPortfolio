Alter the "homepage" with the root location of your portfolio.

You can use the vscode plugin sftp to speed up the deployment to your web server.

Here is the sample simple config you will need to setup in the .vscode folder in sftp.json file

This will connect the sftp plugin to your server so you can just upload the build folder each time you run npm run build 

to make your static site files that are optimized.
